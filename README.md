# Construct3-game
An assigment for one of my classes where I had to create a game using construct 3


You are a Voyager traveling throughout space, trying to get back home.  In order for you to make it back home in one piece. You need to fix your ship while you defend it from the dangers of space travel.
To understand how to use your ship follow along as I describe each part.

  In the Top Right we have the Telescope, which allows you to see incoming threats.

  In the Bottom Left we find the Boosters, which allows you to speed up and down your ship. 

  In the Bottom Right we find the Laser Gun, which allows you to defend your ship.
