# Construct3-game
An assigment for one of my classes where I had to create a game using construct 3  

You are a Voyager traveling throughout space, trying to get back home.  In order for you to make it back home in one piece. You need to fix your ship while you defend it from the dangers of space travel.  
To understand how to use your ship follow along as I describe each part.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Top Right we have the Telescope, which allows you to see incoming threats.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bottom Left we find the Boosters, which allows you to speed up and down your ship.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Bottom Right we find the Laser Gun, which allows you to defend your ship.  


Time to play: Max 5 Mins (300 s):  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-30s Tutorial begins (takes however long it needs to take)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 s - After the Tutorial ends, the game officially starts (Labeled â€œcheckpt, on the timeline)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 s -  5 Light Years away from space station  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15s - First gravity failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33s - Reactor failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50s - Reactor failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60s - 4 Light Years away from space station  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;67s - Gravity failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;80s - Reactor failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112s - Reactor failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;120s - 3  Light Years away from space station

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;225s - Reactor failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;231 - Gravity failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;240 - 1 Light Years away from space station  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;250 - Gravity failure  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;262 - Gravity failure    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;280 - Reactor failure   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;300 - o Light Years away from space station  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destination Reached.
